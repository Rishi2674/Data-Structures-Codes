# Data-Structures-Codes

This is a repository created to store all my codes that I have written during my course of Data Structures in my second semester.
This repo might also contain some codes apart from the course , which may be from the problems solved during competitive programming.
All the codes have been divided into separate folders regarding the topic they belong to.
All the codes have been written in C programming langauge.
